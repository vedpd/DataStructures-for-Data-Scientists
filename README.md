# DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists
This repo has implementation of different data structures and how it can be understood by a data scientist

Following are the implementations that have been done so far:
1.  [Stack](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Stacks_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of Last In First Out<br> <br>
2.  [Queue](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Queue_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of First In First Out <br> <br>
3.  [Deque](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Deque_Implementation.ipynb) - Allows addition and removal from front and rear. <br> <br>

----------------------------------------<b> Algorithm based Questions </b>----------------------------------------------

<b> Stack Based questions </b><br>
4.  [Valid Parenthesis](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Valid_Parenthesis.ipynb) - validating if parenthesis given is in correct order - LeetCode<br><br>

<b> Binary Search based questions </b> <br>
5. [Binary Search for finding element](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Binary_Search.ipynb) - finding position of the element found in a list/array using binary search in case of a sorted list/array - Leetcode <br> <br>
6. [Binary Search for finding element or for inserting a new element](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/BinarySearchInsert_LeetCode.ipynb) - finding position of the element found in a list/array using binary search in case of a sorted list/array. In case element is not in list, finding index at which the new element should be inserted - Leetcode<br><br>
7. [Find first and last index position for repeated values in a sorted array/list](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/FindFirst_Last_SortedArray.ipynb) - Finding Position of starting and ending index for repeating elements in an ascending sorted array- Leetcode <br> <br>
8. [Find peak element in a list](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Find_Peak_Element.ipynb) - find the location of maximum value in a list when the list has a maxima and thus not necessarily an ascending sorted array. <br> <br>

<b> Hashing based questions </b> <br>
9. [Group Anagrams together](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Group_Anagrams.ipynb) - find all the words which are anagrams of each other, group them and return them<br> <br>

<b> Sorting based questions </b> <br>
10. [Merge Intervals](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Merge_Intervals.ipynb) - combine the intervals based on the overlapping intervals to find final list of intervals<br> <br>

<b> Two Pointer questions </b> <br>
11. [Container with most water](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Container_with_most_water.ipynb) - givena list with height at each index along x axis, obtain the max area of rectangular container that can contain most water <br> <br>
12. [Remove duplicates from sorted array](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/26.remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array_v2.py) - given a sorted array we need to remove the duplicate elements, since we need to identify unique element and hence the constraint is to retain values which are unique, we need to keep track of duplicates by traversing over array and then moving the duplicate ones towards end. Thus, this approach requires a 2 pointer based solution.
