This repo has implementation of different data structures and how it can be understood by a data scientist

Following are the implementations that have been done:
1.  [Stack](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Stacks_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of Last In First Out
2.  [Queue](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Queue_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of First In First Out
3.  [Deque](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Deque_Implementation.ipynb) - Allows addition and removal from front and rear.
