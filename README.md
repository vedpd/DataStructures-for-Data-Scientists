# DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists
This repo has implementation of different data structures and how it can be understood by a data scientist

Following are the implementations that have been done so far:
1.  [Stack](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Stacks_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of Last In First Out
2.  [Queue](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Queue_Implementation.ipynb) - works on concept of First In First Out
3.  [Deque](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Deque_Implementation.ipynb) - Allows addition and removal from front and rear.

----------------------------------------Algorithm based Questions-----------------------------------------------------

4.  [Valid Parenthesis](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Valid_Parenthesis.ipynb) - validating if parenthesis given is in correct order  
5. [Binary Search for finding element](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/Binary_Search.ipynb) - finding position of the element found in a list/array using binary search in case of a sorted list/array.
6. [Binary Search for finding element or for inserting a new element](https://github.com/vedpd/DataStructures-for-Data-Scientists/blob/main/BinarySearchInsert_LeetCode.ipynb) - finding position of the element found in a list/array using binary search in case of a sorted list/array. In case element is not in list, finding index at which the new element should be inserted
